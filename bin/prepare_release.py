"""
This script automates the rote work to prepare for a release, as specified in RELEASE.md:

  1) Checks that "Slow Tests" and "Build and Test" (CI) have succeeded on the current commit.
  2) Creates a new annotated tag for the current commit, based on the release version found in RELEASE_NOTES.md.
  3) Attempts to parse the Java code size from the GitHub Actions logs and appends that value (along with the version)
     to java/code_size.json.
  4) Resets RELEASE_NOTES.md to the next presumed version (e.g., incrementing PATCH).
  5) Updates the version throughout the repository to that new version.
  6) Commits these changes in a single "Reset for version X" commit.

Usage:
  1) Ensure you are on the commit you wish to mark as a release
      and that both Build and Test and Slow Tests have passed on that commit.
  2) Run this script: ./prepare_release.py
  3) Push the tag, the tag's commit, and the version reset/update commit to the proper remotes.

  Optional arguments:
    --skip-main-branch-check     Skip the check that ensures we are on 'main' branch.
    --skip-ci-tests-pass-check   Skip the check that continous integration tests have passed on this commit.
    --skip-worktree-clean-check  Skip the check that the working tree is clean before running this script. Not recommended.
